# Let-s-find-a-path
8/8/22
version uploaded on 8/8/22 relies to heavily on calculations and doesn't approach cell and direction selection in a smart way.
Need to exclude steps back and make sure the branches which end up in the same cell are killed off if slower. 
Atm on step 7 allNodesS has around 250,000 entries meaning there's no chance a path would never be found. 

Goal:Improve direction choice, start on the graphics once done with that
