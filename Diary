# Let-s-find-a-path
8/8/22
version uploaded on 8/8/22 relies to heavily on calculations and doesn't approach cell and direction selection in a smart way.
Need to exclude steps back and make sure the branches which end up in the same cell are killed off if slower. 
Atm on step 7 allNodesS has around 250,000 entries meaning there's no chance a path would never be found. 

Goal:Improve direction choice, start on the graphics once done with that

Realized I completely forgot to implement the idea that branches which have kids can't have kids again, also stopped steps backwards. Ssome progress has been made but the 
tipNodesS value still gets up to 200,000 after just a few rounds of calculations which means it is not getting cleared or there is some other underlying issue

Goal: cut down on calculations by making sure the pathways leading to the same point dont both reproduce.
